          I'm a software engineer and designer from Chattanooga, TN. I have been working on websites, software and graphic design over the past 3 years. Since then I have learned many new technologies, languages and techniques to further the craft. I had a lot of fun making this site and the projects presented, so I hope you enjoy!
